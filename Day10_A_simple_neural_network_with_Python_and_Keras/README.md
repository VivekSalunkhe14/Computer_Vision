# A Simple Neural Network with Python and Keras

# Feedforward neural networks
While there are many, many different neural network architectures, the most common architecture is the feedforward network. In this type of architecture, a connection between two nodes is only permitted from nodes in layer i to nodes in layer i + 1 (hence the term feedforward; there are no backwards or inter-layer connections allowed).
Furthermore, the nodes in layer i are fully connected to the nodes in layer i + 1. This implies that every node in layer i connects to every node in layer i + 1.
